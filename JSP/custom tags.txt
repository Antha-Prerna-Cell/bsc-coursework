Steps to make a custom tag -

Make a Tag Library Descriptor in the tlds/custom.tld -> Leave as it is

Make a Tag Handler Class. Give its tld as tlds/custom.tld.  -> Leave as it is

Then come back to tlds/custom.tld.
You'll see that this new tag is already added and its name is same as Handler class name.
Now Specify its name, Attributes & their types etc.


Then come back to its handler class.
Add fields, encapsulate them. Write display code by over riding doTag() function.

Now in the JSP file, use the taglib directive to specify the prefix and URI(path).

Use the tag using <prefix For TLD>:<tagname> attribute="<value>"

Thats all
