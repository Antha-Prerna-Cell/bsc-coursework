Q3 checks for memory refernce instructions ..
here 
it is asked for I=0
that means direct addressing ,
but ,,
while implementing BSA ,
we also need indirect jump of BUN , which isnt possible as I==0

so , BSA cant be implemented with I==0
so ,
in this particular machine of Q3 , we are skipping BSA 

BSA & BUN goes hand in hand 
so ..

in this Ques ,, we skip both BUN & BSA 
further,
both are taken care in Q4
