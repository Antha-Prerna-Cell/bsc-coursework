A few things about LInk list 

1. excetion handling :
		always to be thrown as	 " throw MyException("LInk list error") "
		instead of 		" throw new MyException("LInk list error") "

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------
throw new MyException("LInk list error") 

catch( MyException *ob)
{
	ob->printerror();
}
----------------------------------------------
This shouldn't be used 
as this is throwing a pointer to the newly allocated  memory ,
later after catching , pointer can be deleted, but , there is absolutely no way of deleting this dynamic memory ,
resulting in memory leak ,,
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------
throw MyException("LInk list error") 

catch( MyException ob)
{
	ob.printerror();
}
--------------------------------------
this should always be used , 
although memory is allocated here staticly , but
this way its c++'s problem to deal with it ,,
saves us from leak..
FURTHER ,,,
catching can be done by reference to save some memory
"  catch( MyException &ob) "
both ways are suitable

2. the use of IsInList() func. in delete() is USELESS
suppose element to  be deleted is at n-1 position ,
now IsInList()  traverses it ~ (n-1)
now , delete traverses it  ~ (n-1)
purely useless,
so , it is logical to check for presence in delete func() only
..
like , if the whole list is traversed and still element is not found , temp becomes 0 at last 
so , now, in loop an extra terminating condition would be required which i previously deleted because IsInList() was solving the purpose ,
but now we are not using IsInList() , so condition is req.
then , after loop ,,
by checking if(temp==0)
we can determine if "element is not present
