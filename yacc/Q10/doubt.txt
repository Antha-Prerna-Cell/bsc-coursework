in the last lex rule of negation,

[^a-z0-9\b]    {  c = yytext[0];     return(c);      }

1. what is the logic of returning this 'c'  ??
2. also, this 'c' is not defined as a token in yacc file, so how is this return statement not resulting in an error
3. after i remove these statements, the syntax error msg for unknown symbols disappears. Why and how ??

possible expalnation :
as 'c' is not defined as a token,
it comes under 'error' category,
so,, handled by 'error'
and hence, the syntax error msg gets displayed
